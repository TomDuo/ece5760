readme - Standard Design



Overview:

The standard design is based on the Nios II/s core and provides a typical mix of peripherals and memories. The SOPC Builder system provides an interface to each hardware component on the Nios development board, such as SDRAM, LEDs, RS-232 connector, and the Ethernet MAC/PHY. Many designers use the standard design as a starting point for their own embedded system, and add or remove components to meet their custom requirements. This design is provided for all Altera Nios development boards. 

Contents of the System:

Further notes: 
- The top level of this design is the HDL file generated by SOPC Builder. 
  Clicking on the top level of the hierarchy allows you to view this HDL or open the SOPC Builder tool.

- This Quartus II project contains assignments that match the port names produced by SOPC Builder. 
  If you add or modify SOPC Builder components, the pin assignments may no longer be valid. 
  To view the Assignment Editor in the Quartus II software, in the Assignments menu, click "Assignment Editor".

- The current version of the Nios II EDS hardware design example uses an HDL file as the top level of the design hierarchy.  
  If you would like to use a schematic-based top level instead (BDF), follow the steps listed below.  
  For more information and details, refer to the Nios II Embedded Design Suite Release Note.

1.)  In the Quartus II software, open the top-level HDL file (.v or .vhd) for the design.
2.)  Create a symbol for the HDL file by clicking "File -> Create/Update -> Create Symbol Files for Current File"
3.)  Create a new BDF file by clicking "File -> New -> Block Diagram/Schematic File."
4.)  Instantiate the symbol in the BDF by double-clicking in the empty space of the BDF file and selecting "Project -> <symbol filename>"
5.)  Instantiate pins in the BDF by double-clicking empty space, then typing "input", "output", or "bidir".
6.)  Rename the pins and connect them to the appropriate ports on the symbol.
7.)  Save the BDF as a unique filename.
8.)  Set the BDF as your top level entity by clicking, "Project -> Set as Top-Level Entity".
9.)  Recompile the Quartus II project.
